\titlenote{gem5 is the result of the merger of the GEMS project started in 1999, and the m5 project started in 2003. Development of gem5 has been active for about 20 years, and this version is being published in 2020. Thus, ``gem5-20''.}

    (A sentence about gem5 at a high level.)
    (A sentence about all the features of gem5.)
    The gem5 simulator has been under active development over the last nine years since the original gem5 paper was published.
    In this time, there have been over 7500 commits to the codebase from over 250 unique contributors which have improved the simulator by adding new features, fixing bugs, and increasing the code quality.
    Due to its popularity, the gem5 community has instituted a new meritocratic governance model to encourage community-centric contributions.

\section{Acknowledgements}

The development of gem5 is distributed.
The contributions to the gem5 community go beyond just the source code, and many people who have contributed to the broader gem5 community are not acknowledged here.
Note that until this paper is submitted, please contact Jason Lowe-Power if you have any questions about the contributions.

We would like to specially acknowledge the late Nathan Binkert.
Nate was a driving force behind the creation of gem5 and without his vision and his dedication to code quality this open-source community infrastructure would not be the success that it is today.

The gem5 project management committee consists of Bradford Beckmann, Gabriel Black, Anthony Gutierrez, Jason Lowe-Power (chair), Steven Reinhardt, Ali Saidi, Andreas Sandberg, Matthew Sinclair, Giacomo Travaglini, and David Wood.
Previous members include Nathan Binkert, and Andreas Hansson.
The project management committee manages the administration of the project and ensures that the gem5 community runs smoothly.
